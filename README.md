This is the beginging of my project in which i am trying to create a basketball jump shot tracker where the user can wear a smart watch that can help track the key elements of a jumpshot for future analysis and imporvoment in being more consistent with the jumpshot. This watch should help measure the force applied to the ball, angle of the ball that is launched, ball path that is followed during the jump shot and other key elements of shooting a basketball
