This is the beginging of my project in which I am trying to create a basketball jump shot tracker where the user can wear a smart watch that can help track the key elements of a jumpshot for future analysis and imporvoment in being more consistent with the jumpshot. This watch should help measure the force applied to the ball, angle of the ball that is launched, ball path that is followed during the jump shot and other key elements of shooting a basketball. Some key elements that the jumpshot should analyze is:
The "Pocket" Transition: Measures how quickly and smoothly you bring the ball from your waist to your shooting "pocket."

Set Point Stability: Detects if your arm pauses or wobbles at the peak of your jump.

Wrist Snap Velocity: This is the "money" metric. It calculates the angular velocity of your flick, which directly correlates to ball backspin.

Release Timing: Identifies if you are releasing the ball on the way up (a "one-motion" shot like Steph Curry) or at the apex of your jump (a "two-motion" shot like Kobe Bryant).

Follow-Through Consistency: Monitors how long you hold your hand in the "cookie jar" after the ball is gone.
